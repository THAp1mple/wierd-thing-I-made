# wierd thing I made
 So, this was an Idea from a friend, who said I could not programm a usless machine for him. It is fair to say - **I proved him wrong**.

### What does it do?
 Nothing useful (Except adding 1 to a counter until you get bored - in which case you hit reset). Next!

### What do I need to try it out?
 If you want to reproduce the Cringe with this, you will need:
- A teaspoon of salt,
- Java installed.

### Are there going to be any updates?
 If I update this, I am adding features to a usless thing. That would be counterproductive.

### Have a nice day.
 Yes.
