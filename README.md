# wierd thing I made while having a Cofeine overdose
 So, this was an Idea from a friend, who said I could not programm a usless machine for him. It is fair to say - I proved him wrong.

# What does it do?
 Nothing useful. Next!

# What do I need to try it out?
 If you want to because of the Cringe produced by this you need:
- A teaspoon of salt,
- Java installed.

# Are there going to be any updates?
 If I update this, I am adding features to a usless thing. That would be counterproductive.

# Have a nice day.
 Yes.
